# CollegeList
Colin Williams, Java Programming 2800C,CRN 12389

This code is a Java program that manages a list of three types of people associated with a college: College Employees, Faculty, and Students.

The program employs important programming concepts such as object-oriented programming with encapsulation, class interaction,inheritance, and polymorphism. It uses control structures like loops (do-while) and conditional statements (switch and if) for flow control, and arrays to manage collections of objects. Input handling is done using the Scanner class, with basic input validation and error handling included. 

The expected inputs are a character representing the type of person (C, F, S, or Q) and associated person data (like name or ID), while the outputs include confirmation and error messages, and the display of entered data for College Employees, Faculty, and Students.
